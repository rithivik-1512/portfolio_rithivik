      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I’m a Computer Science and Engineering student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham (CGPA: 8.78),
        passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My interests
        span <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and <b>Machine Learning</b>, including 
        <b> time-series modeling</b>, <b>computer vision</b>, and 
        <b> natural language processing</b>. I enjoy working across the full ML lifecycle—from 
        data preprocessing and feature engineering to designing deep-learning models and deploying 
        optimized solutions for edge and real-time environments. I also draw on my experience in 
        <b> software engineering</b>, dashboard development, and web technologies to create AI systems 
        that are both technically robust and user-centric.
